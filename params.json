Supports visual creation and manipulation\r\nof Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) and Nondeterministic Finite Automata (NFA)\r\n(i.e., has the functionality of an automata editor) and provides access for common\r\noperations on Finite State Machines (FSM) provided by the FSAUtils library.\r\n\r\n**There exists a first 0.1-alpha release with an attached executable standalone jar file - check this out**\r\n(https://github.com/rindPHI/FSAUtilsGUI/releases) **!**\r\n\r\nFeatures supported so far\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\n* Visual creation of DFA/NFA\r\n* Visual edition of DFA/NFA\r\n* Save and load from/to serialized XML\r\n* Simple XML text editor\r\n* Front-end for common operations supported by FSAUtils:\r\n  * Acceptance / Equivalence check\r\n  * Union, Intersection, Star, ...\r\n  * Minimization of DFA\r\n  * Determinization of NFA\r\n  * Extraction of Regular Expressions\r\n  \r\nNote that the current release is a non-production one, so you might experience glitches\r\nfor instance in the visual editor. If you have problems with the editor, you still have\r\nthe option of directly editing the XML file, so keep this in mind ;)\r\n\r\nGet Started\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n**Prerequisites:** You need to have Scala and the JVM installed. FSAUtils GUI\r\nhas been tested with Scala 2.11.2 and Java 1.7. Furthermore, the environment\r\nvariable `$SCALA_HOME` has to be correctly set to the path where Scala resides.\r\nFurthermore, the visual editor also uses Graphviz which therefore has to be\r\ninstalled on your system.\r\n\r\nThe following steps should work for a Linux system.\r\n\r\n1. Download and build FSAUtils (https://github.com/rindPHI/FSAUtils).\r\n\r\n2. Download the archive:\r\n   \r\n   ```bash\r\n   wget https://github.com/rindPHI/FSAUtilsGUI/archive/master.zip -O FSAUtilsGUI-master.zip\r\n   ```\r\n   \r\n3. Unzip it:\r\n   \r\n   ```bash\r\n   unzip FSAUtilsGUI-master.zip\r\n   ```\r\n   \r\n4. Build it:\r\n   \r\n   ```bash\r\n   cd FSAUtilsGUI-master\r\n   ant\r\n   ```\r\n   \r\n   As the result, you find an executable jar file \"FSAUtils_GUI.jar\" in the directory `lib/`.\r\n   \r\n5. ...and run it:\r\n   \r\n   ```bash\r\n   java -jar lib/FSAUtils_GUI.jar\r\n   ```\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nCopyright 2014 Dominic Scheurer\r\n    \r\nThis file is part of FSAUtilsGUI.\r\n     \r\nFSAUtilsGUI is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\r\n(at your option) any later version.\r\n     \r\nFSAUtilsGUI is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
