Get Started
-----------

**Prerequisites:** You need to have Scala and the JVM installed. FSAUtils GUI
has been tested with Scala 2.11 and Java 1.7. Furthermore, the environment
variable `$SCALA_HOME` has to be correctly set to the path where Scala resides.

The following steps should work for a Linux system.

1. Build FSAUtils.

2. Download the archive:
   
   ```bash
   wget https://github.com/rindPHI/FSAUtils/archive/master.zip
   ```
   
3. Unzip it:
   
   ```bash
   unzip master.zip
   ```
   
4. Build it:
   
   ```bash
   cd FSAUtils-master
   ant
   ```
   
   As the result, you find a file "FSAUtils.jar" in the directory `lib/`
   which you need to add to the classpath of scalac and scala in order
   to compile / run your objects that make use of FSAUtils.
   
5. ...and run it:
   
   ```bash
   scala -classpath ".:/path/to/FSAUtils.jar" YourObject
   ```
